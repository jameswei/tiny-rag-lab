# Integrating with Google Cloud Platform

# Integrating with Google Cloud Platform #

You can configure an integration with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to allow IBM watsonx users to access data sources from GCP\. Before proceeding, make sure you have proper permissions\.

After you configure an integration, you'll see it under **Service instances**\. For example, you'll see a new **GCP** tab that lists your BigQuery data sets and Storage buckets\.

To configure an integration with GCP:

<!-- <ol> -->

1.  Log on to the Google Cloud Platform at [https://console\.cloud\.google\.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)\.
2.  Go to **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts**\.
3.  Open your project and then click **CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**\.1\. Specify a name and description for the new service account and click **CREATE**\. Specify other options as desired and click **DONE**\.1\. Click the actions menu next to the service instance and select **Create key**\. For key type, select **JSON** and then click **CREATE**\. The JSON key file will be downloaded to your machine\.
    
    Important: Write down your key ID and secret and store them in a sStore the key file in a secure location.
4.  In IBM watsonx, under **Administrator > Cloud integrations**, go to the **GCP** tab, enable integration, and then paste the contents from the JSON key file into the text field\. Only certain properties from the JSON will be stored, and the `private_key` property will be encrypted\.
5.  Go back to Google Cloud Platform and edit the service account you created previously\. Add the following roles:
6.  Confirm that you can see your GCP services\. From the main menu, choose **Administration > Services > Services instances**\. Click the **GCP** tab to see those services, for example, BigQuery data sets and Storage buckets\.

<!-- </ol> -->

Now users who have credentials to your GCP services can can [create connections](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/manage-data/create-conn.html) to them by selecting them on the **Add connection** page\. Then they can access data from those connections by [creating connected data assets](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/manage-data/connected-data.html)\.
