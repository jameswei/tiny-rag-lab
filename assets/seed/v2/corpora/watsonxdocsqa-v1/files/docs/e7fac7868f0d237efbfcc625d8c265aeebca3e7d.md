1.  Add a Data Asset node that points to  hotelSatisfaction\.csv\.
2.  From the  Text Analytics category on the node palette, add a Text Mining node, connect it to the Data Asset node you added in the previous step, and double\-click it to open its properties\.
3.  Under  Fields, select `Comments` for the  Text field and select `id` for the  ID field\. Note that only the  Text field is required\.

4.  Under  Copy resources from, select  Text analysis package, click  Select Resources, and then load  Hotel Satisfaction (English)\.tap (with `Current category set(s) = Topic + Opinion`)\.A text analysis package (TAP) is a predefined set of libraries and advanced linguistic and nonlinguistic resources bundled with one or more sets of predefined categories\. If no text analysis package is relevant for your application, you can instead start by selecting  Resource template under  Copy resources from\. A resource template is a predefined set of libraries and advanced linguistic and nonlinguistic resources that have been fine\-tuned for a particular domain or usage\.

5.  Under  Build models, make sure  Build interactively (category model nugget) is selected\. Later when you run the node, this option will launch an interactive interface (known as the Text Analytics Workbench) in which you can extract concepts and patterns, explore and fine\-tune the extracted results, build and refine categories, and build category model nuggets\.
6.  Under  Begin session by, select  Extracting concepts and text links\. The option  Extracting concepts extracts only concepts, whereas TLA extraction outputs both concepts and text links that are connections between topics (service, personnel, food, etc\.) and opinions\.
7.  Under  Expert, select  Accommodate spelling for a minimum word character length of\. This option applies a fuzzy grouping technique that helps group commonly misspelled words or closely spelled words under one concept\. The fuzzy grouping algorithm temporarily strips all vowels (except the first one) and strips double/triple consonants from extracted words and then compares them to see if they're the same (so, for example, `location` and `locatoin` are grouped together)\.
