# Deployment space collaborator roles and permissions

# Deployment space collaborator roles and permissions #

When you add collaborators to a deployment space, you can specify which actions they can do by assigning them access levels\. Learn how to add collaborators to your deployment spaces and the differences between access levels\.

## User roles and permissions in deployment spaces ##

You can assign the following roles to collaborators based on the access level that you want to provide:

<!-- <ul> -->

 *  **Admin**: Administrators can control your deployment space assets, users, and settings\.
 *  **Editor**: Editors can control your space assets\.
 *  **Viewer**: Viewers can view your deployment space\.

<!-- </ul> -->

The following table provides details on permissions based on user access level:

### Service IDs ###

You can create service IDs in IBM Cloud to enable an application outside of IBM Cloud access to your IBM Cloud services\. Service IDs are not tied to a specific user\. Therefore, if a user leaves an organization and is deleted from the account, the service ID remains\. Thus, your application or service stays up and running\. For more information, see [Creating and working with service IDs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-serviceids)\.

To learn more about assigning space access by using a service ID, see [Adding collaborators to your deployment space](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/collaborator-permissions-wml.html?context=cdpaas&locale=en#adding-collaborators)\.

## Adding collaborators to your deployment space ##

**Prerequisites:**  
All users in your IBM Cloud account with the **Admin** IAM platform access role for all IAM enabled services can manage space collaborators\. For more information, see [IAM Platform access roles](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/roles.html#platform)\.

**Restriction:**  
You can add collaborators to your deployment space only if they are a part of your organization and if they provisioned Watson Studio\.

To add one or more collaborators to a deployment space:

<!-- <ol> -->

1.  From your deployment space, go to the **Manage** tab and click **Access Control**\.
2.  Click **Add collaborators** and choose one of the following options:
    
    <!-- <ul> -->
    
     *  If you want to add a user, click **Add users**. Assign a role that applies to the user.
     *  If you want to add pre-defined user groups, click . Assign a role that applies to all members of the group.
    
    <!-- </ul> -->
    
3.  Add the user or user groups that you want to have the same access level and click **Add**\.

<!-- </ol> -->
